      "source": "# GROUP BY... HAVING and COUNT\n\nNow that we know how to select the content of a column, we're ready to learn how to group your data and count things within those groups. This can help you answer questions like: \n\n* How many of each kind of fruit has our store sold?\n* How many species of animal has the vet office treated?\n\nTo do this, we're going to learn about three new techniques: GROUP BY, HAVING and COUNT. Once again, we're going to use this 100% made up table of information on various pets, which has three columns: one with the unique ID number for each pet, one with the name of the pet and one with the species of the animal (rabbit, cat or dog). \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ef4Puo3.png)\n\n### COUNT\n___\n\nCOUNT(), as you may have guessed from the name, returns a count of things. If you pass it the name of a column, it will return the number of entries in that column. So if we SELECT the COUNT() of the ID column, it will return the number of ID's in that column.\n\n    SELECT COUNT(ID)\n    FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets`\n    \nThis query, based on the table above, will return 4 because there are 4 ID's in this table.\n \n### GROUP BY\n___\n\nGROUP BY takes the name of one or more column and tells SQL that we want to treat rows that have the same value in that column as a single group when we apply aggregate functions like COUNT().\n\n> An **aggregate function** takes in many values and returns one. Here, we're learning about COUNT() but there are other aggregate functions like SUM() and AVERAGE().\n\nNote that because it tells SQL how to apply aggregate functions, it doesn't make sense to use GROUP BY without something like COUNT(). \n\nLet's look at an example. We want to know how many of each type of animal we have in our table. We can get this information by using GROUP BY to group together rows that have the same value in the “Animal” column, while using COUNT() to find out how many ID's we have in each group. You can see the general idea in this image:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MFRhycu.png)\n\nThe query that will get us this information looks like this:\n\n    SELECT Animal, COUNT(ID)\n    FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets`\n    GROUP BY Animal\n\nThis query will return a table with two columns (Animal & COUNT(ID)) three rows (one for each distinct Animal). \n\nOne thing to note is that if you SELECT a column that you don't pass to 1) GROUP BY or 2) use as input to an aggregate function, you'll get an error. So this query won't work, because the Name column isn't either passed to either an aggregate function or a GROUP BY clause:\n\n    # NOT A VALID QUERY! \"Name\" isn't passed to GROUP BY\n    # or an aggregate function\n    SELECT Name, Animal, COUNT(ID)\n    FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets`\n    GROUP BY Animal\n    \nIf make this error, you'll get the error message `SELECT list expression references column (column's name) which is neither grouped nor aggregated at`.\n\n### GROUP BY ... HAVING\n___\n\nAnother option you have when using GROUP BY is to specify that you want to ignore groups that don't meet certain criteria. So this query, for example, will only include groups that have more than one ID in them:\n\n    SELECT Animal, COUNT(ID)\n    FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets`\n    GROUP BY Animal\n    HAVING COUNT(ID) > 1\n\nThe only group that this query will return information on is the one in the cells highlighted in blue in this figure:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8xutHzn.png)\n\nAs a result, this query will return a table with only one row, since this there only one group remaining. It will have two columns: one for \"Animal\", which will have \"Cat\" in it, and one for COUNT(ID), which will have 2 in it. "
